Based on analyzing how Fitbit consumers use and respond to features, recommendations can be made to promote further growth for Bellabeat.\n\nThe Bellabeat app should be completely enhanced and revamped. Rather than simply providing data on user’s health, the app should further encourage users to meet fitness goals and become a social media platform.\n\nThe CDC recommends working out with a friend in order to feel more motivated, be more adventurous in trying workouts, and to become consistent. \n\nThe CDC even recommends the use of a social media workout app to connect with friends and reach your goals. The Bellabeat app could become that social media workout app that women turn to, by creating an online community of supportive women ready to prioritize their health.\n\n### Recommendations for Bellabeat app:\n\n1. Enable social networking so users can post their favorite workouts, wellness tips, healthy meals, etc.\n\n2. Enable users to add friends and view each other’s activity.\n\n3. Create weekly fitness and wellness challenges to encourage use.\n\n4. Recommend users to get 10,000 steps a day and enable alert notifications to encourage users to meet goal.\n\n5. Recommend users to get at least 7 hours of sleep a night and enable alert notifications to encourage users to meet this.\n\n6. Recommend users get 75 minutes of vigorous activity a week and enable alert notifications to entourage users to meet this.\n\n7. Have health and fitness companies pay for advertising.\n\n8. Encourage users to enter in weight and height to track BMI.\n\n9. If users are interested in losing weight, enable notifications to keep users on track to burn necessary calories to meet goal.\n\n10. Enable alert notifications if user’s resting heart rate varies significantly from their normal.\n\n11. Enable notifications to encourage activity if a user has spent an hour in bed awake.\n\n12. Enable notifications to encourage activity if a user has been sedentary for an extended period of time.\n\n### Recommendations for Bellabeat membership:\n\n1. Partner with health & fitness companies and offer discounts for members.\n\n2. Offer reduced subscription fee when a member refers a friend.\n\n3. Offer 30-day free trial subscription\n\n4. Offer discounts for Bellabeat smart device products with membership.\n\n### Recommendations for Bellabeat products:\n\n1. Offer a bundle deal for the Spring and Leaf together.\n\n2. Heavily market Spring as Fitbit does not track hydration levels.\n\n### Works Cited:\n\n“The Dangers of Sitting: Why Sitting Is the New Smoking.” The Dangers of Sitting: Why Sitting Is the New Smoking — Better Health Channel, 22 Aug. 2020, www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/healthyliving/the-dangers-of-sitting\n\n\"3 Reasons to Work out with a Friend.” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 23 Apr. 2021, www.cdc.gov/diabetes/library/spotlights/workout-buddy.html\n\n“About Adult Bmi.” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 17 Sept. 2020, www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/assessing/bmi/adult_bmi/index.html\n\nGornall, Lucy. “How to Lose Weight: How Many Calories Should i Eat to Lose Weight?” GoodtoKnow, 12 Aug. 2020, www.goodto.com/wellbeing/diets-exercise/what-is-calorie-how-many-lose-weigt-425557\n\n“CDC — How Much Sleep Do I Need? — Sleep and Sleep Disorders.” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2 Mar. 2017, www.cdc.gov/sleep/about_sleep/how_much_sleep.html\n\nReed, Martin. “Spend Less Time In Bed If You Want More Sleep.” Healthcentral.com, 7 May 2017, www.healthcentral.com/article/spend-less-time-in-bed-if-you-want-more-sleep\n\nRoland, James. “What Are Mets, and How Are They Calculated?” Healthline, Healthline Media, 21 Oct. 2019, www.healthline.com/health/what-are-mets#calculation\n\nGrey, Heather. “Heart Rates Can Vary by 70 Bpm: What That Means for Your Health.” Healthline, Healthline Media, 9 Feb. 2020, www.healthline.com/health-news/what-your-heart-rate-says-about-your-health\n\n“How Much Physical Activity Do Adults Need?” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 7 Oct. 2020, www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/basics/adults/index.htm\n\nNield, David. “Scientists Figured out How Much Exercise You Need to ‘Offset’ a Day of Sitting.” ScienceAlert, 26 Nov. 2020, www.sciencealert.com/getting-a-sweat-on-for-30-40-minutes-could-offset-a-day-of-sitting-down\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
